This is a record of my 100 days of code. I started off in a different repository but I'm becoming increasingly aware of the need to organize my code well for these 100 days. 

I struggle a lot with being stuck in tutorial hell so I'm devoting this time to learning how to code in JavaScript effectively and building confidence in my ability to use code to solve complex problems. I'm going to be using Eloquent JavaScript to guide my learning and use my old python tuts and labs for extra practice.

#100DaysOfCode: Day 5 (07 Jan)
Did the FizzBuzz challenge. I feel like I'm doing stuff that's a bit too simple but I'm learning to trust the process and pay attention to the basics. I may write a blog post to explain what I did and the concepts in use.

It's a fairly easy problem to solve and a simple if/else statement inside a loop delivers the solution.

#100DaysOfCode: Day 6 (08 Jan)

Today I'm learning about all the different ways of declaring functions in JavaScript, the implications of each one and how scope comes into play. So far, function expressions and arrow functions do pretty much the same thing but arrow functions were introduced so we could write simple functions in a less verbose way. I'll still be making extensive use of them because it seems they are a key component of the frameworks I want to learn. 

Also covered optional parameters, closures, pure functions and recursion, but I feel like I need to spend a couple of days on recursive functions and find a few problems to solve with that way of writing functions. Also, why in the name of all things good does recursion even exist?

#100DaysOfCode: Day 7 (10 Jan)

I had a power cut yesterday so I didn't manage to write any code. Today I'm still going on with functions but I seem to be struggling with what I think is a simple problem. 

Also read about objects, methods and properties, as well as arrays and their methods. The problem that's currently making me contemplate the meaning of life requires me to write a function that takes in two integer parameters and returns the array of numbers between them. For some reason my array comes up empty each time and I am so confused.

So it turns out I was trying to use range.push[i] instead of range.push(i). Once again, something small and simple can completely trip you up. Lesson of the day: SQUARE BRACKETS ARE NOT FOR FUNCTIONS!!!

Slightly humbled by this experience. I think I have a new appreciation for grasping the basics and not trying to rush to the "fun stuff". I have 100 days to get familiar with JavaScript and all year to prepare myself for a career transition into front end development. I get to spend time becoming familiar with this language and I want to be the best JavaScript developer I can be. Patience is my friend.
